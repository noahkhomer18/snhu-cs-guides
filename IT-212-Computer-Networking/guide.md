# IT-212 Introduction to Computer Networks (SNHU) ‚Äî Survival Guide

## üîç What to Expect

- Understanding hardware & software layers of networking (OSI model, protocols).  
- Designing basic networks: IP addressing, subnetting, server/client system, firewall/security basics.  
- Labs/projects may include setting up network diagrams, secure network environment, configuring basic network devices/services.  

## üìÖ Flow (Typical Modules)

| Module | Topics | Deliverables |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Fundamentals: networking layers, OSI vs TCP/IP model | Quiz / diagram assignment |
| 2 | IP addressing & subnetting | Lab: subnet calculations + designing addressing scheme |
| 3 | Network hardware & client/server basics | Assignment: design network including server, client, firewall |
| 4 | Security basics: firewalls, secure services | Project: secure network design document + configurations |
| 5 | Putting it together: diagrams + rationale | Final deliverable: network diagram + justification + report |

## ‚ö† Common Pitfalls

- Mistakes in subnet math / addressing, broadcast vs network IP, etc.  
- Overlooking security basics (e.g. firewall rules, open ports).  
- Diagrams that don't match written justification.  
- Not testing "edge case" network configs (e.g., overlap, wrong mask).  

## ‚úÖ Tips to Succeed

- Practice IP/subnet calculations a lot (online tools help).  
- Draw diagrams first. Use software or even pen-and-paper before implementing.  
- Read about common attacks / network vulnerabilities so you understand design trade-offs.  
- Use example SNHU labs or resources (if you find classmates' notes) for clarity.
