## üîß Implementation Notes

### Security Best Practices
- **Default Deny**: Block all traffic by default
- **Least Privilege**: Only allow necessary ports/protocols
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate guest network
- **Regular Updates**: Keep firewall firmware current

### Monitoring
- Log all denied connections
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Set up alerts for failed login attempts
- Regular security audits

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist
- [ ] Web server accessible from internet
- [ ] File server accessible from workstations only
- [ ] Guest network isolated from internal
- [ ] DNS resolution working
- [ ] Email access (if applicable)
