# CS-300 Data Structures & Algorithms: Analysis & Design (SNHU)

## üîç What to Expect

- Combines **coding** with non-coding design methods: pseudocode, algorithmic design, complexity analysis.  
- Key data structures: vectors, linked lists, hash tables, binary search trees.  
- Sorting & searching algorithms; file I/O (CSV or text files).  
- Pre-req courses: MAT-230 or MAT-239, and CS-210 or CS-217.  

## üìÖ Typical Flow / Modules

| Module | Topic | Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Algorithm design / Big-O, pseudocode, vectors | Lab on vector operations, pseudocode exercises |
| 2 | Linked lists: singly/doubly, insertion/deletion | Implementation + reflection |
| 3 | Sorting algorithms (selection, insertion, merge, quick) | Project or module comparing sorts & runtime |
| 4 | Hash tables (collision, chaining) | Lab + test cases |
| 5 | Trees, especially BSTs | Traversals, delete/insert, performance evaluation |
| 6 | File I/O + combining multiple structures | Final project / combined data processing |
| 7 | Portfolio / reflections / performance & code documentation | Project + write-up + code + tests |

## ‚ö† Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring edge cases (empty structures, mismatched inputs)  
- Poor pseudocode / skipping design thinking ‚Üí more bugs later  
- Not testing runtime on large inputs; only small ones mislead  
- Weak reflections: just saying "it worked" isn't enough

## ‚úÖ Tips to Succeed

- Write pseudocode / design before writing code  
- Test with small and large datasets  
- Measure runtime where required  
- Use sample repos (e.g. SNHU-CS300 from vhicktour) to model structure & style
