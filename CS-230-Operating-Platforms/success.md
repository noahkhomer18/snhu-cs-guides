# CS-230 Success Guide 🎯

---

## 🗝️ How to Get an A
- Take notes during **zyBooks labs** — they directly map to assignments.  
- Treat **discussion posts** as mini research papers: cite real OS sources, not just personal opinion.  
- Use **VMs / Apporto** to practice commands rather than just copying code. Professors like screenshots and proof-of-work.  
- Start the **final project** by Week 5 — it's larger than it looks.  

---

## 📆 Weekly Routine
- **Mon–Wed** → Do zyBooks modules and labs.  
- **Thu–Fri** → Draft paper/reflection assignments.  
- **Sat** → Run experiments in Apporto / local VM, collect screenshots.  
- **Sun** → Finalize submissions.  

---

## ⚠️ Mistakes That Cost Points
- Ignoring technical depth in papers (professors want analysis, not generalizations).  
- Not citing OS documentation → flagged for plagiarism or low score.  
- Submitting labs without screenshots or proof.  
- Forgetting APA formatting (always required).  

---

## 🎯 Keys to an A
- ✅ Show command outputs and explain results in your own words.  
- ✅ Compare platforms with evidence (benchmarks, case studies).  
- ✅ Submit polished APA papers.  
- ✅ Plan final project early.
