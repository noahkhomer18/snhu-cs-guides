```

## üîç Project Management Best Practices

### Time Management
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focused work sessions
- **Time Blocking**: Dedicate specific time slots for different tasks
- **Buffer Time**: Add 20% extra time to estimates
- **Regular Reviews**: Weekly progress assessments

### Communication
- **Weekly Updates**: Regular progress reports to instructor
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed logs of decisions and changes
- **Version Control**: Use Git for code and documentation
- **Backup Strategy**: Multiple backup locations

## üí° Learning Points
- Detailed planning prevents scope creep and missed deadlines
- Regular progress tracking helps identify issues early
- Risk management prepares you for potential problems
- Clear documentation supports successful project completion
- Time management skills are crucial for capstone success
