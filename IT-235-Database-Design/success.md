## 🎯 What Gets You an A

- ER diagrams that clearly map to user requirements, with correct attributes, keys, and relationships.  
- Complete normalization steps documented (1NF → 2NF → 3NF).  
- Schema design includes constraints (primary key, foreign key, unique, etc.).  
- Sample queries / test data showing that schema works.  
- Reflective work: why you designed schema this way, trade-offs, what you'd change.
