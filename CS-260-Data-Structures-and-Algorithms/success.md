# CS-260 Success Guide

## 🎯 How to Earn an A
- Start labs early: pointer bugs take hours to debug.
- Don't just "make it work" — explain **why** you chose a structure.
- Write journals with depth: include trade-offs, edge cases, and Big-O.

## 📋 Rubric Checklist
- ✔️ Correct implementation of required data structures
- ✔️ Algorithms analyzed with Big-O
- ✔️ Reflection journals written with reasoning
- ✔️ Edge cases tested (empty, large, duplicates)
- ✔️ Clean, modular, documented code
- ✔️ Diagrams included for trees/graphs

## 💡 Pro Tips
- Use unit testing (`assert` in C++) for each operation.
- Revisit earlier labs before the final project.
- Comment your code to explain pointer moves.
- Compare runtimes of sorting algorithms with actual measurements.
