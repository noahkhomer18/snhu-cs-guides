# SVD and Image Compression Assignment Guide

This folder provides teaching resources and examples for the SVD/image compression assignment. **All code examples use different data** to demonstrate methodology without solving the assignment directly.

## Structure

- `guides/structure_guide.md` - What each part should contain
- `templates/` - Code scaffolds with placeholders
- `examples/teaching_examples.m` - Working examples using different matrices
- `examples/good_style.m` - Proper commenting and formatting examples
- `helpers/` - Reusable functions (RMSE, compression formulas)
- `rubrics/checklist.md` - What graders look for
- `notes/common_pitfalls.md` - Frequent mistakes

## Important Notes

- Code examples demonstrate concepts but do NOT solve the assignment
- Teaching examples use different matrices/data than the assignment
- Replace placeholders with your own work based on assignment requirements
