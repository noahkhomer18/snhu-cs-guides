# Grading Checklist

## Part 1: Rank-1 Approximation
- [ ] MATLAB code using `svd()` function
- [ ] `A1` clearly stated and rounded to 4 decimal places
- [ ] RMSE calculation shown
- [ ] Code or terminal output included

## Part 2: Rank-2 Approximation
- [ ] MATLAB code using `svd()` function
- [ ] `A2` clearly stated and rounded to 4 decimal places
- [ ] RMSE calculation shown
- [ ] Comparison: Which approximation is better? Why?

## Part 3: Vector Operations
