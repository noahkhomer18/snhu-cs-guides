# Common Pitfalls

- Treating capacities as equalities without justification
- Flipping directions between variable definition and equations
- Omitting nonnegativity (xi â‰¥ 0)
- Inflow/outflow mismatch at nodes (missing external terms)
- Over/undercounting at merge node (E) when multiple inputs/outputs
- Assembling Ax = b with row/column orders inconsistent with declared x
