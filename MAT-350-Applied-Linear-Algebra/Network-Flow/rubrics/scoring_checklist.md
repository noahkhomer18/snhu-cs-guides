# Scoring Checklist (Qualitative)

Modeling (A)
- Variables x1..x5 defined with clear directions
- External inflow/outflow identified separately

Equations (B)
- Five node-balance equations present (A–E), directions consistent
- No double-counting; receiver edges treated appropriately

Ax = b (C)
- Order of x declared; A is 5×5; b is 5×1
- Coefficients placed correctly from node equations
- Determinacy note (rank vs unknowns) addressed

Constraints (D)
- Nonnegativity and capacities expressed as inequalities
- Discussion of “binding” vs “nonbinding” where relevant

Reasoning (E)
- Global inflow/outflow check
- Bottleneck identification tied to model (not guesses)
- Table filled qualitatively with short justifications

Communication (F)
- Clear, concise, well-structured explanations
- No numeric answers leaked in scaffold deliverables
