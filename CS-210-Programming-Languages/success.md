# CS-210 Success Guide 🎯

---

## 🗝️ How to Get an A
- **Stay ahead in zyBooks**: Do 10–15 sections per day; don't binge.  
- **Start Project 1 early**: Aim to finish a draft by mid-Week 2.  
- **Dedicate serious time to Project 2**: 2+ hours daily from Week 5 onward.  
- **Document everything**: Comment your code, cite any external references.  
- **Test edge cases**: Time rollovers (11:59 → 12:00), negative deposits, invalid input.

## 📆 Weekly Routine
- **Mon–Tue** → Do zyBooks sections, 10 per day.  
- **Wed–Thu** → Work on project milestones.  
- **Fri–Sat** → Debug & refine code.  
- **Sun** → Post reflections, finalize deliverables.

## ⚠️ Mistakes That Cost Points
- Poor formatting and lack of comments.  
- Submitting Project 2 last minute (biggest grade risk).  
- Missing citations → flagged for plagiarism.  
- Ignoring reflections → easy points lost.
