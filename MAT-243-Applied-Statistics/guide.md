# MAT-243 Applied Statistics for Scientists (SNHU)

## ðŸ“Š What to Expect
Introductory probability & statistics applied to scientific and CS contexts. Covers:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation)
- Probability rules & distributions (binomial, normal, Poisson)
- Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals
- Correlation & regression
- ANOVA and chi-square testing

## ðŸ“… Flow
- Weekly problem sets (calculations + short writing)
- Labs in Excel, R, or Python (visualizing distributions, hypothesis testing)
- Midterm & Final exams
- Final project applying statistical analysis to a dataset

## âš  Pitfalls
- Forgetting assumptions of tests (normality, independence)
- Misinterpreting p-values / confidence intervals
- Mixing up one-tailed vs two-tailed tests
- Weak explanations in written interpretations

## âœ… Tips to Succeed
- Practice with real datasets (Kaggle, UCI repository)
- Use statistical software (R, Python) for calculations
- Always state assumptions before running tests
- Interpret results in context, not just numbers
