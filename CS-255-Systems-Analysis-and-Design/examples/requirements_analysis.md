### Use Case Analysis

#### Use Case: Schedule Patient Appointment
```
Use Case Name: Schedule Patient Appointment
Actor: Receptionist
Description: Receptionist schedules a new appointment for a patient

Preconditions:
- Receptionist is logged into the system
- Patient exists in the system
- Doctor's schedule is available

Main Flow:
1. Receptionist selects "Schedule Appointment"
2. System displays appointment scheduling form
3. Receptionist enters patient ID
4. System displays patient information
5. Receptionist selects doctor and date
6. System displays available time slots
7. Receptionist selects preferred time slot
8. System confirms appointment details
9. Receptionist confirms appointment
10. System creates appointment record
11. System sends confirmation to patient

Alternative Flows:
3a. Patient ID not found
   3a1. System displays error message
   3a2. Receptionist can create new patient record
   3a3. Continue from step 4

7a. No time slots available
   7a1. System displays alternative dates
   7a2. Receptionist selects different date
   7a3. Continue from step 6

Postconditions:
- Appointment is scheduled in the system
- Patient receives confirmation
- Doctor's schedule is updated
```

## üîç Requirements Analysis Best Practices

### Requirements Gathering Techniques
- **Interviews**: One-on-one sessions with key stakeholders
- **Surveys**: Structured questionnaires for large groups
- **Observation**: Watching users perform current tasks
- **Workshops**: Group sessions for collaborative requirements
- **Prototyping**: Building mockups to validate requirements

### Requirements Quality Criteria
- **Complete**: All necessary requirements are included
- **Consistent**: No conflicts between requirements
- **Correct**: Requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs
- **Unambiguous**: Requirements have only one interpretation
- **Testable**: Requirements can be verified through testing

### Common Requirements Issues
- **Scope Creep**: Requirements expanding beyond original scope
- **Ambiguous Language**: Vague or unclear requirement statements
- **Missing Requirements**: Important requirements not identified
- **Conflicting Requirements**: Requirements that contradict each other
- **Over-specification**: Too much detail in requirements

## üí° Learning Points
- Requirements analysis is iterative and collaborative
- Stakeholder involvement is critical for success
- Requirements must be testable and measurable
- Change management is essential for project control
- Documentation quality affects project success
