## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Noah Khomer** — a Computer Science major at Southern New Hampshire University (B.S. in Computer Science, graduating 2025).  

- 🎓 Double degree holder: B.S. in Business Administration (Project Management & Information Systems) + B.S. in Computer Science  
- 📊 Currently pursuing dual master's degrees in **Computer Science** and **Business**  
- 💻 Passionate about **web development, AI/ML, and full-stack engineering**  
- 🌐 Portfolio: [noah-khomer.com](https://noah-khomer.com)  
- 🔗 GitHub: [@noahkhomer18](https://github.com/noahkhomer18) • [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/noahkhomer18/)  

I built this repo to give back to the SNHU community. While I was working through my program, I often had to dig through Reddit threads, GitHub repos, and peer conversations just to piece together what a course was really asking for. This project consolidates that knowledge so future students can succeed without confusion.  

💡 **Motto:** Knowledge is power, and there's no substitute for hard work.

## ⚠️ Purpose & Academic Integrity

This project exists to give you an **extensive idea of what each course covers** — the tools you'll use, the types of assignments you'll face, and the common struggles students encounter.  

👉 **What this is NOT:**
- ❌ A copy-paste repository of assignments  
- ❌ A cheating shortcut or answer bank  
- ❌ A way to bypass learning the skills yourself  

👉 **What this IS:**
- ✅ A structured guide to the SNHU CS program  
- ✅ Study material, resources, and curated advice  
- ✅ Insight into workload, milestones, and what to expect  

⚠️ **Do not cheat.** It's not worth it. Employers expect graduates to know how to build, debug, and deploy real projects. If you skip the work, you'll only hurt yourself and saturate the market without being able to even run `npm start` on your own code.  

This repo is meant to **support your learning**, not replace it. Course content can (and does) change over time, so always check against your **instructor's directions, rubrics, and updated course materials**.

---

## ⭐ Support & Future Updates

If you find this guide helpful, please **star this repository** ⭐ — it helps other SNHU students discover it.  

I'll be **constantly editing and improving** these guides as courses evolve and new tools come into play.  

🚀 Next chapter: I am also enrolling in a **Master's in Computer Science**. As I progress through those graduate-level courses, I will **add new guides and resources** here to expand the collection beyond the B.S. program.

## 🌟 Final Note

If you're an SNHU CS student:  
- Use this guide to get a head start.  
- Plan your time wisely — most courses follow an 8-week sprint model.  
- Take notes, experiment, and build beyond the minimum requirements.  

If you're an alum or current student who wants to contribute, feel free to fork, improve, or share additional study resources for these courses.  
Together, we can make the SNHU CS journey clearer and less stressful for everyone.
