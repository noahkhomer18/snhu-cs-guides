# 🎓 SNHU Computer Science Study Guides

This repository is a **complete collection of guides for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**.  

Each course has its own folder containing:
- 📝 **guide.md** — a detailed, student-friendly survival guide (1+ pages per course)
- 🔗 **resources.md** — key links (zyBooks, tools, Reddit threads, GitHub examples)
- 💻 **examples/** — starter code, templates, or small scripts where applicable

The goal is to help SNHU CS students succeed by providing **clear expectations, milestone breakdowns, common pitfalls, and practical tips** for earning an A.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Noah Khomer** — a Computer Science major at Southern New Hampshire University (B.S. in Computer Science, graduating 2025).  

- 🎓 Double degree holder: B.S. in Business Administration (Project Management & Information Systems) + B.S. in Computer Science  
- 📊 Currently pursuing dual master's degrees in **Computer Science** and **Business**  
- 💻 Passionate about **web development, AI/ML, and full-stack engineering**  
- 🚀 Creator of the **100 Days of Coding** challenge, where I build and deploy projects daily (React apps, APIs, data tools, and more)  
- 🌐 Portfolio: [noah-khomer.com](https://noah-khomer.com)  
- 🔗 GitHub: [@noahkhomer18](https://github.com/noahkhomer18) • [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahkhomer18/)  

I built this repo to give back to the SNHU community — when I was working through my CS program, I often pieced together info from Reddit, GitHub, and classmates. This project puts it all in one place to help future students succeed.  

💡 **Motto:** Knowledge is power, and there's no substitute for hard work.

## 📌 Scope of This Guide

As of **September 10th, 2025**, this guide only contains **major Computer Science courses**.  
It will remain focused exclusively on **core CS coursework**.  

Why?  
- Common Core, General Education, Arts, and Elective courses (e.g., history, humanities, sociology) are **not included**, since they are not directly part of the CS curriculum.  
- Most SNHU CS students **transfer in** a large portion of these credits (I personally transferred **70+ credits** from platforms such as **Sophia.org**, **Study.com**, CLEP exams, AP credits, and community college coursework).  
- Because these are widely satisfied through transfer credit, this guide is focused only on the **Computer Science stack** — the classes that actually build programming, math, systems, and engineering skills.  

✅ **Included:** All CS major requirements + supporting math/physics courses (Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Physics, etc.)  
❌ **Excluded:** General education, electives, non-CS requirements  

This keeps the repo streamlined, relevant, and valuable to CS majors who want insight into the **real technical workload**.

## ⚠️ Purpose & Academic Integrity

This project exists to give you an **extensive idea of what each course covers** — what to expect, what tools are used, common challenges, and how to prepare.  

👉 **What this is NOT:**
- ❌ No copy-paste assignments  
- ❌ No cheating solutions  
- ❌ No shortcuts to bypass the work  

👉 **What this IS:**
- ✅ A structured guide to the SNHU CS program  
- ✅ Study material, resources, and tips  
- ✅ Insight into milestones, workload, and expectations  

Remember: **do not cheat**. Do not use online tools to bypass your learning — it's not worth it. You'd only hurt yourself and saturate the job market without the skills to even run `npm start` on a project.  

This repo is designed to **support your learning**, not replace it. Course material can (and does) change over time, so always double-check against your instructor's directions and rubrics.
