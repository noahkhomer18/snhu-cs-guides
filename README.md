# 🎓 SNHU Computer Science Study Guides

Welcome! This repository is a **comprehensive collection of study guides for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**.  

The purpose of this project is to provide **future and current SNHU CS students** with:
- Clear expectations of what each course involves
- Milestone breakdowns and weekly workload overviews
- Practical study tips to succeed
- Common pitfalls and lessons learned
- Starter code, reference links, and tool setup notes

> ⚡️ This is not a solution bank or assignment archive. Instead, it's a **roadmap** designed to help you understand *what to expect, how to prepare, and how to navigate the program with confidence*.

## 📌 Scope of This Guide

As of **September 10th, 2025**, this guide only contains **major Computer Science courses**.  

Why not include General Education, Electives, or Common Core?  
- Those courses (history, humanities, sociology, etc.) aren't unique to Computer Science and don't contribute directly to technical skills.  
- Most students **transfer those credits in** before or during the program.  
- I personally transferred **70+ credits** using platforms like **Sophia.org**, **Study.com**, CLEP exams, AP credits, and community college classes.  

Because of that, this repository will **only include courses from the CS major stack** — the ones that actually teach programming, data structures, software engineering, and system-level skills.  

✅ Included: Computer Science courses + required math/physics support  
❌ Excluded: General Education, electives, and unrelated credits  

This keeps the project focused and valuable for CS majors who want to know what the **technical workload** looks like.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Noah Khomer** — a Computer Science major at Southern New Hampshire University (B.S. in Computer Science, graduating 2025).  

- 🎓 Double degree holder: B.S. in Business Administration (Project Management & Information Systems) + B.S. in Computer Science  
- 📊 Currently pursuing dual master's degrees in **Computer Science** and **Business**  
- 💻 Passionate about **web development, AI/ML, and full-stack engineering**  
- 🚀 Creator of the **100 Days of Coding** challenge, where I build and deploy projects daily (React apps, APIs, data tools, and more)  
- 🌐 Portfolio: [noah-khomer.com](https://noah-khomer.com)  
- 🔗 GitHub: [@noahkhomer18](https://github.com/noahkhomer18) • [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/noahkhomer18/)  

I built this repo to give back to the SNHU community. While I was working through my program, I often had to dig through Reddit threads, GitHub repos, and peer conversations just to piece together what a course was really asking for. This project consolidates that knowledge so future students can succeed without confusion.  

💡 **Motto:** Knowledge is power, and there's no substitute for hard work.

## ⚠️ Purpose & Academic Integrity

This project exists to give you an **extensive idea of what each course covers** — the tools you'll use, the types of assignments you'll face, and the common struggles students encounter.  

👉 **What this is NOT:**
- ❌ A copy-paste repository of assignments  
- ❌ A cheating shortcut or answer bank  
- ❌ A way to bypass learning the skills yourself  

👉 **What this IS:**
- ✅ A structured guide to the SNHU CS program  
- ✅ Study material, resources, and curated advice  
- ✅ Insight into workload, milestones, and what to expect  

⚠️ **Do not cheat.** It's not worth it. Employers expect graduates to know how to build, debug, and deploy real projects. If you skip the work, you'll only hurt yourself and saturate the market without being able to even run `npm start` on your own code.  

This repo is meant to **support your learning**, not replace it. Course content can (and does) change over time, so always check against your **instructor's directions, rubrics, and updated course materials**.

## 🌟 Final Note

If you're an SNHU CS student:  
- Use this guide to get a head start.  
- Plan your time wisely — most courses follow an 8-week sprint model.  
- Take notes, experiment, and build beyond the minimum requirements.  

If you're an alum or current student who wants to contribute, feel free to fork, improve, or share additional study resources for these courses.  
Together, we can make the SNHU CS journey clearer and less stressful for everyone.
