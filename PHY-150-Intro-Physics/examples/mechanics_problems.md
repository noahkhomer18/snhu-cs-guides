## üéØ Purpose
Comprehensive guide to solving mechanics problems in introductory physics, including kinematics, dynamics, and energy conservation.

## üìù Mechanics Problem Examples

### Example 1: Kinematics - Projectile Motion

**Problem**: A ball is thrown horizontally from a height of 20m with an initial velocity of 15 m/s. Find:
a) How long it takes to hit the ground
b) How far horizontally it travels
c) Its velocity when it hits the ground

**Solution**:
```python
import math

# Given data
h = 20  # height in meters
v0x = 15  # initial horizontal velocity in m/s
v0y = 0   # initial vertical velocity in m/s
g = 9.8  # acceleration due to gravity in m/s¬≤

# Part a: Time to hit the ground
# Using y = y0 + v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t¬≤
# When ball hits ground: y = 0, y0 = h
# 0 = h + v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t¬≤
# 0 = 20 + 0*t - (1/2)*9.8*t¬≤
# 0 = 20 - 4.9*t¬≤
# t¬≤ = 20/4.9
# t = sqrt(20/4.9)

t = math.sqrt(h / (0.5 * g))
print(f"Time to hit ground: {t:.2f} seconds")

# Part b: Horizontal distance
# x = x0 + v0x*t
x = v0x * t
print(f"Horizontal distance: {x:.2f} meters")

# Part c: Velocity when hitting ground
# vx = v0x (constant)
# vy = v0y - g*t
vx = v0x
vy = v0y - g * t
v_magnitude = math.sqrt(vx**2 + vy**2)
angle = math.degrees(math.atan(vy/vx))

print(f"Final velocity: {v_magnitude:.2f} m/s at {angle:.1f}¬∞ below horizontal")
```

### Example 2: Dynamics - Newton's Laws

**Problem**: A 5kg block is pulled by a 30N force at 30¬∞ above horizontal on a frictionless surface. Find:
a) The acceleration of the block
b) The normal force
c) If the coefficient of friction is 0.2, find the new acceleration

**Solution**:
```python
import math

# Given data
m = 5  # mass in kg
F = 30  # applied force in N
theta = 30  # angle in degrees
mu = 0.2  # coefficient of friction

# Convert angle to radians
theta_rad = math.radians(theta)

# Part a: Acceleration on frictionless surface
# Fx = F*cos(theta) = ma
Fx = F * math.cos(theta_rad)
a_frictionless = Fx / m
print(f"Acceleration (frictionless): {a_frictionless:.2f} m/s¬≤")

# Part b: Normal force
# Fy = F*sin(theta) + N - mg = 0
# N = mg - F*sin(theta)
N = m * 9.8 - F * math.sin(theta_rad)
print(f"Normal force: {N:.2f} N")

# Part c: Acceleration with friction
# Fx - f = ma
# f = mu * N
f = mu * N
Fx_net = Fx - f
a_with_friction = Fx_net / m
print(f"Acceleration (with friction): {a_with_friction:.2f} m/s¬≤")
```

### Example 3: Energy Conservation

**Problem**: A 2kg block slides down a frictionless ramp from height 3m, then encounters a rough surface with Œº = 0.3. How far does it slide on the rough surface?

**Solution**:
```python
# Given data
m = 2  # mass in kg
h = 3  # initial height in m
mu = 0.3  # coefficient of friction
g = 9.8  # acceleration due to gravity

# At the top of the ramp
# Potential energy: PE = mgh
# Kinetic energy: KE = 0
PE_initial = m * g * h
KE_initial = 0
print(f"Initial potential energy: {PE_initial:.2f} J")

# At the bottom of the ramp (just before rough surface)
# All PE converted to KE
# PE_final = 0, KE_final = (1/2)mv¬≤
# Conservation of energy: PE_initial = KE_final
# mgh = (1/2)mv¬≤
# v¬≤ = 2gh
v_bottom = math.sqrt(2 * g * h)
print(f"Velocity at bottom of ramp: {v_bottom:.2f} m/s")

# On rough surface
# Work done by friction = -Œºmgd
# Final KE = 0
# Work-energy theorem: W = ŒîKE
# -Œºmgd = 0 - (1/2)mv¬≤
# Œºmgd = (1/2)mv¬≤
# d = v¬≤/(2Œºg)

d = v_bottom**2 / (2 * mu * g)
print(f"Distance on rough surface: {d:.2f} m")
```
