# PHY-150 Intro Physics Guide

## âš› Topics
- Kinematics (motion, velocity, acceleration)  
- Newton's laws & forces  
- Energy, work, power  
- Momentum, collisions  
- Rotational motion  
- Electricity & magnetism intro  

## ðŸ“… Flow
- Labs: motion sensors, force measurements, energy experiments.  
- Homework: problem solving + conceptual Qs.  
- Exams: numerical + conceptual.  

## âš  Pitfalls
- Not showing work (partial credit requires formulas).  
- Units mistakes (always convert to SI).  
- Memorizing formulas without understanding concepts.  

## âœ… Tips
- Start with units/dimensions check for each equation.  
- Draw free-body diagrams (forces, momentum).  
- Use online sims like [PhET Physics](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/physics).
