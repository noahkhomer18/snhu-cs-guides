# Practices for Secure Software Report

## Executive Summary
This report outlines secure software development practices implemented to address identified vulnerabilities and strengthen overall system security.

## Security Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- **Before**: Direct user input processing
- **After**: Server-side validation with whitelist approach
- **Impact**: Prevents injection attacks

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 3. Data Protection
- **Before**: Plain text storage
- **After**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Impact**: Protects sensitive data

### 4. Dependency Management
- **Before**: Outdated libraries
- **After**: Regular updates, vulnerability scanning
- **Impact**: Reduces known vulnerability exposure

## Recommendations
- Implement continuous security monitoring
- Regular penetration testing
- Security training for development team
