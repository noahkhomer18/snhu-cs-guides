# CS-250 Real-World SDLC Scenarios

## üéØ Purpose
Demonstrate real-world SDLC scenarios where project managers and software engineers collaborate through the development lifecycle, showing practical application of SDLC principles.

## üìù Real-World Project Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform Migration (ChadaTech Case Study)

#### Project Overview
**Company**: ChadaTech (fictional company from CS-250)
**Project**: Migrate legacy e-commerce system to modern cloud-based platform
**Timeline**: 6 months
**Team Size**: 12 people (1 PM, 2 Tech Leads, 6 Developers, 2 QA, 1 DevOps)

#### Project Manager Responsibilities

##### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (Weeks 1-2)
**PM Tasks:**
- Stakeholder interviews with business users, IT department, and customers
- Document current system limitations and pain points
- Define success criteria and acceptance criteria
- Create project charter and scope document

**Real-World Example:**
```
Stakeholder Interview Notes - Sarah Chen (VP of Sales)
Date: March 15, 2024
Interviewer: Project Manager (Alex Rodriguez)

Key Pain Points:
- Current system crashes during Black Friday traffic spikes
- Mobile experience is poor, losing 40% of mobile customers
- Integration with new payment processors takes 3+ months
- Customer service reps can't access order history in real-time

Success Criteria:
- 99.9% uptime during peak traffic
- Mobile conversion rate increase by 25%
- New payment integration in under 2 weeks
- Real-time order tracking for customer service
```

##### Phase 2: Planning & Design (Weeks 3-6)
**PM Tasks:**
- Create detailed project plan with milestones
- Coordinate with architects on system design
- Establish communication protocols
- Set up project management tools (Jira, Confluence)

**Software Engineer Perspective:**
```
Developer Journal Entry - Week 4
Author: Maria Santos (Senior Full-Stack Developer)

This week I'm working on the API architecture design. The PM (Alex) has been great at 
facilitating discussions between the frontend and backend teams. We had a technical 
spike session where we evaluated different approaches:

1. Microservices vs Monolithic approach
2. Database design for scalability
3. Authentication and authorization strategy

Alex helped us understand the business constraints:
- Must support 10x current traffic
- Integration with 5 different payment processors
- Real-time inventory updates
- Mobile-first responsive design

The PM's role here is crucial - they translate business requirements into technical 
constraints that we can work with. Without clear direction from the PM, we'd be 
building features that don't align with business goals.
```

##### Phase 3: Development (Weeks 7-20)
**PM Tasks:**
- Daily standup facilitation
- Sprint planning and retrospectives
- Risk management and issue resolution
- Stakeholder communication

**Real-World Sprint Planning Example:**
```
Sprint 3 Planning Meeting - April 8, 2024
Sprint Goal: Implement user authentication and basic product catalog

Attendees: PM (Alex), Tech Lead (David), 4 Developers, QA Lead (Jennifer)

PM Opening: "Based on our stakeholder feedback, we need to prioritize the mobile 
experience. The business is losing customers due to poor mobile performance."

Sprint Backlog:
- User Registration API (8 points) - Assigned to Maria
- Mobile-responsive product grid (5 points) - Assigned to James
- Authentication middleware (3 points) - Assigned to Sarah
- Product search functionality (8 points) - Assigned to Mike
- Unit tests for auth module (2 points) - Assigned to David

PM Facilitation:
- "Maria, do you have any blockers for the registration API?"
- "James, the mobile grid needs to work on iOS Safari - that's been a pain point"
- "Let's make sure we have test coverage before we move to integration testing"

Sprint Commitment: 26 story points
Risk Identified: Third-party authentication service integration complexity
PM Action: Schedule technical spike with vendor support team
```

##### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (Weeks 21-24)
**PM Tasks:**
- Coordinate testing schedules
- Manage bug triage and prioritization
- Ensure test coverage meets requirements
- Facilitate user acceptance testing

**QA Engineer Perspective:**
```
Testing Journal - Week 22
Author: Jennifer Liu (QA Lead)

The PM has been instrumental in coordinating our testing efforts. We discovered 
a critical performance issue during load testing - the system couldn't handle 
Black Friday traffic levels.

PM Response:
- Immediately escalated to technical team
- Scheduled emergency architecture review
- Coordinated with DevOps for infrastructure scaling
- Communicated potential delay to stakeholders

Without the PM's quick response and coordination, we would have discovered this 
issue in production. The PM's risk management skills saved the project from 
a major failure.
```

## üîç Software Engineer Perspectives in SDLC

### Developer Experience in Agile Environment

#### Sprint Planning from Developer View
```
Developer Reflection - Sprint 5
Author: Michael Chen (Senior Developer)

The PM's role in sprint planning is crucial for our success. Here's what I've learned:

1. Clear Requirements:
   - PM translates business needs into technical stories
   - Provides context for why features are important
   - Helps prioritize based on business value

2. Resource Management:
   - Ensures we have the right skills on each story
   - Coordinates with other teams for dependencies
   - Manages external vendor relationships

3. Risk Management:
   - Identifies potential technical risks early
   - Coordinates with stakeholders for risk mitigation
   - Escalates issues that could impact delivery

Example from this sprint:
The PM identified that our payment integration was at risk due to vendor API changes. 
Instead of discovering this mid-sprint, the PM coordinated a technical spike with 
the vendor, allowing us to adjust our approach before committing to the sprint.

Without the PM's proactive risk management, we would have failed to deliver on time.
```

#### Code Review and Quality Assurance
```
Code Review Process - Week 12
Author: Sarah Johnson (Tech Lead)

The PM has established a quality gate process that ensures code quality:

1. Pre-commit Requirements:
   - All code must pass unit tests
   - Code coverage must be above 80%
   - Security scan must pass
   - Performance benchmarks must be met

2. Review Process:
   - Peer review required for all changes
   - Tech lead approval for critical components
   - PM sign-off for user-facing features

3. Quality Metrics:
   - PM tracks quality metrics weekly
   - Identifies trends and improvement areas
   - Coordinates training when needed

PM Quality Dashboard:
- Code coverage: 85% (target: 80%)
- Bug escape rate: 2% (target: <5%)
- Performance regression: 0 (target: 0)
- Security vulnerabilities: 0 (target: 0)

The PM's focus on quality metrics helps us maintain high standards while 
delivering features on time.
```

### DevOps and Deployment Coordination

#### Deployment Process Management
```
Deployment Coordination - Production Release
Author: David Kim (DevOps Engineer)

The PM coordinates our deployment process to ensure smooth releases:

1. Pre-deployment:
   - PM coordinates with all teams for deployment readiness
   - Ensures all testing is complete
   - Manages stakeholder communication

2. Deployment:
   - PM facilitates deployment meetings
   - Coordinates rollback procedures if needed
   - Manages communication during deployment

3. Post-deployment:
   - PM coordinates monitoring and validation
   - Manages issue resolution if problems arise
   - Facilitates post-deployment review

Real Example:
During our last deployment, we discovered a database migration issue. The PM 
immediately:
- Coordinated with the database team for rollback
- Communicated status to stakeholders
- Facilitated root cause analysis
- Updated deployment procedures

The PM's coordination prevented a major production incident and ensured 
quick resolution.
