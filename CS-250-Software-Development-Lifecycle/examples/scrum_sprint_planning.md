## üîç Sprint Planning Best Practices

### Story Point Estimation
- **1-2 points**: Simple task, well understood
- **3-5 points**: Moderate complexity, some unknowns
- **8 points**: Complex task, multiple unknowns
- **13+ points**: Too large, needs to be broken down

### Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] Code written and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] UI/UX approved by designer
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product owner acceptance
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Sprint Metrics
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Burndown**: Remaining work over time
- **Sprint Goal Achievement**: Percentage of goal met
- **Team Satisfaction**: Retrospective feedback

## üí° Learning Points
- Sprint goals provide focus and alignment
