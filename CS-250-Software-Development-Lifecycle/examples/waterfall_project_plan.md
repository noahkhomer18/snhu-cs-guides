| 1-3 | User Management | Team A | In Progress |
| 4-6 | Catalog System | Team B | Planned |
| 7-9 | Circulation | Team A | Planned |
| 10-12 | Reporting | Team B | Planned |

##### Code Standards
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches
- **Code Review**: All code reviewed by senior developer
- **Testing**: Unit tests with 80% coverage minimum
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and API docs

#### Phase 4: Testing (4 weeks)

##### Test Plan
1. **Unit Testing** (Week 1)
   - Individual component testing
   - Automated test suite execution
   - Code coverage analysis

- **Week 2**: Production deployment and go-live

##### Rollback Plan
- Database backup and restore procedures
- Application rollback to previous version
- Communication plan for stakeholders

#### Phase 6: Maintenance (Ongoing)

##### Support Plan
- **Level 1**: Basic user support and bug fixes
- **Level 2**: System administration and monitoring
- **Level 3**: Development team for major issues

## üîç Waterfall Methodology Characteristics

### Advantages
- **Clear Structure**: Well-defined phases and deliverables
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation
- **Predictability**: Fixed timeline and budget
- **Quality Control**: Extensive testing phase

### Disadvantages
- **Rigidity**: Difficult to accommodate changes
- **Late Feedback**: User input only at the end
- **Risk**: Issues discovered late in process
- **Time**: Longer development cycles

### When to Use Waterfall
- **Clear Requirements**: Well-understood project scope
- **Stable Technology**: Mature technology stack
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Strict documentation requirements
- **Large Teams**: Multiple teams with clear handoffs

## üí° Learning Points
- Waterfall provides structure but lacks flexibility
- Documentation is critical for project success
- Testing phase is comprehensive but late
- Change management is challenging
- Suitable for projects with clear, stable requirements
