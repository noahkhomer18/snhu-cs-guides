# CS-250 Project Estimation

## 🎯 Purpose
Demonstrate various project estimation techniques and methodologies.

## 📝 Estimation Examples

### Story Point Estimation

#### Planning Poker Example
```
User Story: "As a user, I want to search for products by category"

Team Discussion:
- Frontend: "Need to create search UI and filters" (5 points)
- Backend: "Simple database query with category filter" (3 points)
- Testing: "Need to test various search scenarios" (2 points)
- Design: "Search interface design and UX" (3 points)

Consensus: 5 story points
```

#### Story Point Scale
```
1 point  - Trivial task (30 minutes)
2 points - Simple task (1-2 hours)
3 points - Small task (half day)
5 points - Medium task (1-2 days)
8 points - Large task (3-5 days)
13 points - Very large task (1-2 weeks)
21 points - Epic (needs breakdown)
```

### Function Point Analysis

```

#### Effort Estimation
```
Function Points: 58
Productivity Rate: 8 hours per FP
Total Effort: 58 × 8 = 464 hours
Team Size: 4 developers
Duration: 464 ÷ (4 × 40) = 2.9 months
```

### Three-Point Estimation

#### PERT Estimation Example
```
Task: Implement user authentication system

Optimistic (O): 3 days
Most Likely (M): 5 days
Pessimistic (P): 8 days

Expected Duration (E) = (O + 4M + P) ÷ 6
E = (3 + 4×5 + 8) ÷ 6 = 31 ÷ 6 = 5.2 days

Standard Deviation (SD) = (P - O) ÷ 6
SD = (8 - 3) ÷ 6 = 0.83 days

Confidence Intervals:
- 68% confidence: 5.2 ± 0.83 days (4.4 - 6.0 days)
- 95% confidence: 5.2 ± 1.66 days (3.5 - 6.9 days)
```

### Resource Estimation

#### Team Composition
```
Project: Mobile Banking App (6 months)

Development Team:
- Project Manager: 1 FTE × 6 months = 6 person-months
- Technical Lead: 1 FTE × 6 months = 6 person-months
- iOS Developer: 1 FTE × 6 months = 6 person-months
- Android Developer: 1 FTE × 6 months = 6 person-months
- Backend Developer: 1 FTE × 6 months = 6 person-months
- Frontend Developer: 0.5 FTE × 6 months = 3 person-months
- QA Engineer: 1 FTE × 4 months = 4 person-months
- UI/UX Designer: 0.5 FTE × 3 months = 1.5 person-months

Total: 38.5 person-months
```

#### Cost Estimation
```
Personnel Costs:
- Project Manager: $8,000/month × 6 = $48,000
- Technical Lead: $10,000/month × 6 = $60,000

### Estimation Accuracy Tracking

#### Estimation vs Actual Tracking
```
Sprint 1 Estimation vs Actual:

| Task | Estimated (hours) | Actual (hours) | Variance | Accuracy |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| User Login | 16 | 20 | +25% | 80% |
| Product Search | 24 | 18 | -25% | 125% |
| Shopping Cart | 32 | 35 | +9% | 91% |
| Payment Integration | 40 | 45 | +13% | 89% |

Average Accuracy: 96%
Team Velocity: 112 story points
```

#### Estimation Improvement Process
```
1. Track estimation accuracy for each sprint
2. Identify patterns in over/under-estimation
3. Adjust estimation techniques based on learnings
4. Update team velocity based on actual performance
5. Refine story point values based on complexity

Example Adjustments:
- Authentication tasks: +20% (security complexity)
- UI tasks: -10% (reusable components)
- Integration tasks: +15% (third-party dependencies)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Estimation

#### Monte Carlo Simulation
```
Task: Database Migration

Base Estimate: 5 days
Risk Factors:
- Data corruption risk: +2 days (20% probability)
- Performance issues: +1 day (30% probability)
- Rollback needed: +1 day (10% probability)

Simulation Results (1000 iterations):
- 50th percentile: 5.2 days
- 80th percentile: 6.1 days
- 95th percentile: 7.3 days

Recommended Estimate: 6.5 days (80th percentile)
```

## 🔍 Estimation Best Practices

### Estimation Techniques
- **Multiple Methods**: Use different techniques and compare results
- **Historical Data**: Base estimates on similar past projects
- **Expert Judgment**: Leverage team experience and domain knowledge
- **Bottom-up**: Break down large tasks into smaller, estimable pieces

### Improving Accuracy
- **Regular Review**: Track and analyze estimation accuracy
- **Team Calibration**: Ensure consistent understanding of effort levels
- **Risk Consideration**: Account for uncertainty and risks
- **Continuous Learning**: Update estimation models based on experience

### Common Pitfalls
- **Optimism Bias**: Tendency to underestimate effort
- **Anchoring**: Being influenced by initial estimates
- **Scope Creep**: Not accounting for changing requirements
- **Resource Constraints**: Ignoring team availability and skills

## 💡 Learning Points
- Estimation is inherently uncertain and improves with experience
- Multiple estimation techniques provide better accuracy
- Historical data is crucial for improving estimates
- Risk factors should be explicitly considered
- Regular tracking and adjustment improve estimation accuracy over time
