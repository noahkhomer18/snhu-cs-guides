# CS-250 SDLC Methodology Comparison

## üéØ Purpose
Compare different SDLC methodologies with real-world examples, showing how project managers and software engineers adapt to different approaches based on project requirements and constraints.

## üìù SDLC Methodology Overview

### Waterfall Methodology

#### Characteristics
- **Sequential Phases**: Each phase must be completed before the next begins
- **Documentation Heavy**: Extensive documentation at each phase
- **Predictable**: Clear timeline and deliverables
- **Risk Management**: Early identification and mitigation of risks

#### Real-World Example: Banking System Implementation
```
Project: Core Banking System Upgrade

Timeline: 18 months
Team: 25 people (1 PM, 3 Tech Leads, 15 Developers, 4 QA, 2 DevOps)

PM Responsibilities (Sarah Thompson):
1. Requirements Phase (Months 1-3):
   - Detailed requirements gathering with business users
   - Regulatory compliance documentation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation planning
   - Stakeholder sign-off on requirements

2. Design Phase (Months 4-6):
   - System architecture design
   - Database design and optimization
   - Security and compliance design
   - Technical specification documentation

3. Development Phase (Months 7-12):
   - Code development following specifications
   - Unit testing and code reviews
   - Integration testing preparation
   - Progress reporting to stakeholders

4. Testing Phase (Months 13-15):
   - System testing and integration testing
   - User acceptance testing
   - Performance and security testing
   - Bug fixing and resolution

5. Deployment Phase (Months 16-18):
   - Production deployment
   - User training and support
   - System monitoring and maintenance
   - Post-deployment review and lessons learned
```

#### Engineer Perspective - Waterfall
```
Developer Journal - Banking System Project
Author: David Kim (Senior Developer)
Phase: Development (Month 8)

"Working in a Waterfall environment requires different skills and approaches:

1. Detailed Planning:
   - Requirements are fully defined before development starts
   - Technical specifications are comprehensive and detailed
   - Development tasks are clearly defined and estimated

2. Documentation Focus:
   - Extensive documentation is required at each phase
   - Code must be well-documented and maintainable
   - Technical decisions must be documented and justified

3. Quality Focus:
   - High emphasis on code quality and testing
   - Comprehensive testing at each phase
   - Regulatory compliance requirements

4. PM Coordination:
   - PM provides clear direction and requirements
   - Regular progress reporting and status updates
   - Risk management and issue resolution
   - Stakeholder communication and management

Example Development Task:
Implementing the account balance calculation module:
- Requirements: Calculate account balance with interest and fees
- Design: Object-oriented design with clear interfaces
- Implementation: Clean, maintainable code with comprehensive tests
- Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests
- Documentation: Technical documentation and user guides

The PM's role is crucial in ensuring requirements are clear and stakeholders 
are aligned. Without clear requirements, development would be chaotic and 
inefficient."
```

### Agile Methodology

#### Characteristics
- **Iterative Development**: Short development cycles (sprints)
- **Collaborative**: Close collaboration between team members and stakeholders
- **Adaptive**: Ability to respond to changing requirements
- **Customer Focus**: Regular feedback and validation

#### Real-World Example: Mobile App Development
```
Project: Healthcare Mobile App
Company: MedTech Solutions
Timeline: 6 months
Team: 12 people (1 PM, 2 Tech Leads, 6 Developers, 2 QA, 1 DevOps)

PM Responsibilities (Lisa Rodriguez):
1. Sprint Planning (Every 2 weeks):
   - Product backlog refinement
   - Sprint goal definition
   - Story estimation and assignment
   - Risk identification and mitigation

2. Daily Coordination:
   - Daily standup meetings
   - Impediment removal
   - Team coordination and support
   - Stakeholder communication

3. Sprint Review:
   - Demo completed features
   - Stakeholder feedback collection
   - Product backlog updates
   - Next sprint planning

4. Retrospective:
   - Team performance review
   - Process improvement identification
   - Action item planning
   - Continuous improvement
```

#### Engineer Perspective - Agile
```
Developer Journal - Healthcare Mobile App
Author: Maria Santos (Senior Developer)
Sprint: 5 (Weeks 9-10)

"Agile development requires different skills and approaches:

1. Iterative Development:
   - Short development cycles with frequent feedback
   - Continuous integration and deployment
   - Regular testing and validation
   - Adaptive planning and execution

2. Collaboration:
   - Close collaboration with PM and stakeholders
   - Regular communication and feedback
   - Cross-functional team coordination
   - Shared responsibility for project success

3. Quality Focus:
   - Continuous testing and validation
   - Code review and pair programming
   - Automated testing and deployment
   - Continuous improvement

4. PM Coordination:
   - PM facilitates team coordination and communication
   - Regular sprint planning and review sessions
   - Impediment removal and issue resolution
   - Stakeholder management and communication

Example Sprint Work:
Sprint 5 - Patient Portal Features:
- User authentication and security
- Patient data display and management
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Notification system implementation

PM Facilitation:
- Coordinated sprint planning with clear goals
- Facilitated daily standups for progress tracking
- Removed impediments and resolved issues
- Coordinated with stakeholders for feedback

The PM's role in Agile is more facilitative than directive. They help the 
team work effectively rather than managing tasks directly."
```

### DevOps Methodology

#### Characteristics
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Automated build, test, and deployment
- **Collaboration**: Close collaboration between development and operations
- **Automation**: Automated processes and workflows
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and feedback
