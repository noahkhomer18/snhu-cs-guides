## üìù Software Engineer Role Throughout SDLC

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Technical Planning

#### Engineer Responsibilities
- **Technical Feasibility**: Assess technical feasibility of requirements
- **Architecture Design**: Contribute to system architecture and design decisions
- **Technology Selection**: Recommend appropriate technologies and tools
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify technical risks and mitigation strategies

#### Real-World Example: E-commerce Platform Architecture
```
Technical Planning Session - ChadaTech E-commerce Migration
Date: March 20, 2024
Participants: PM (Alex), Tech Lead (David), Senior Developers (Maria, James)

Engineer Perspective - Maria Santos (Senior Full-Stack Developer):

"During the requirements phase, I worked closely with Alex (PM) to translate 
business requirements into technical specifications. Here's what I learned:

1. Business Context is Critical:
   - PM provided context on why certain features are important
   - Helped me understand user pain points and business goals
   - Enabled me to make better technical decisions

2. Technical Feasibility Assessment:
   - Evaluated different technology stacks for scalability
   - Assessed integration complexity with existing systems
   - Identified potential technical risks early

3. Architecture Decisions:
   - Microservices vs monolithic architecture
   - Database design for high availability
   - Caching strategy for performance
   - Security implementation approach

Example Technical Decision:
The PM identified that mobile performance is critical for business success. 
This influenced our architecture decision to implement:
- CDN for static assets
- API optimization for mobile networks
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Offline functionality for core features

Without the PM's business context, I might have chosen a different architecture 
that wouldn't meet the business requirements."
