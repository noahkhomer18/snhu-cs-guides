# CS-250 Success Guide 🎯

---

## 🗝️ How to Get an A
- **Follow rubrics** line by line. Missing one bullet (like acceptance criteria) tanks grades.  
- Write **professional requirements**:  
  - ❌ Bad: "System should be user friendly."  
  - ✅ Good: "System shall display dashboard metrics within 2 seconds for 100 concurrent users."  
- For journals, write **as if you were in the role** (Scrum Master, Developer). Be reflective and specific.  
- APA citations required — use Agile Alliance, Scrum.org, or textbooks.

## 📆 Weekly Strategy
- **Mon–Tue** → Read materials, outline deliverables.  
- **Wed–Thu** → Draft requirements or diagrams.  
- **Fri** → Revise with APA citations.  
- **Sat–Sun** → Proofread and submit polished docs.  

---

## ⚠️ Mistakes That Cost Points
- Vague user stories ("As a user, I want a login") → must include *acceptance criteria*.  
- Forgetting APA references.  
- Submitting messy UML diagrams.  
- Treating Agile reflections casually — they need depth.  

---

## 🎯 Keys to an A
- ✅ Deliverables that look like **real project documents**  
- ✅ Show strong understanding of Agile vs Waterfall trade-offs  
- ✅ Tie testing strategy directly to requirements  
- ✅ Start final project by **Week 5** (not Week 8!)
