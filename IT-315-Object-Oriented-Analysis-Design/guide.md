# IT-315 Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (SNHU)

## ðŸ“˜ What to Expect

- Heavy use of **UML diagrams**: use-case, class, sequence, CRC cards.  
- Use-case driven, architecture-centric, iterative/incremental development.  
- Final project in parts: first diagrams / design, then method specs, then refinement & reflection.  

## ðŸ“… Typical Flow

| Module | Topic | Deliverables |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Use-Cases + System Requirements Analysis | Use-case diagrams, requirement docs |
| 2 | Class diagrams, CRC cards | Class + CRC assignments |
| 3 | Sequence / interaction diagrams | Project part with sequence diagrams |
| 4 | Method & behavior specifications + documentation | Project part with specs & reflection |
| 5 | Review & validation + alignment with requirements | Test / peer review / update diagrams & design |
| 6 | Final project submission + reflection | All diagrams, method specs, full design docs |

## âš  Common Pitfalls

- Diagrams inconsistent (use-case says something different than class or sequence)  
- Skipping CRC cards or treating them as trivial  
- Superficial method specs (just headings but no behavior)  
- Weak reflections / not documenting why design decisions were made

## âœ… Tips to Succeed

- Use reliable UML tools (Lucidchart, Draw.io)  
- Draft use-cases early, review with peers if possible  
- Consistently maintain requirements â†’ ensure design matches them  
- For final project, consolidate all diagrams & method specs in README
