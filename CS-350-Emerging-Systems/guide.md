# CS-350 Emerging Systems Survival Guide

## ðŸ”¬ What to Expect
Focuses on **low-level systems and embedded programming**:  
- Memory, CPU, and registers  
- Embedded C for microcontrollers  
- System architecture trade-offs (efficiency vs cost vs constraints)

## ðŸ“… Flow
- **Labs**: bit manipulation, assembly/C code, register programming.  
- **Project**: design an embedded system (timer, controller, simple IoT).  
- **Journals**: trade-offs in architecture and design decisions.  

## âš  Pitfalls
- Forgetting **constraints** (RAM, CPU cycles, energy).  
- Misunderstanding registers & bitwise operations.  
- Journals lacking depth in trade-offs and rationale.  

## âœ… Tips
- Practice C pointer/bit ops before starting labs.  
- Use diagrams to visualize system architecture.  
- Test on real or simulated hardware if possible (Arduino, STM32).
